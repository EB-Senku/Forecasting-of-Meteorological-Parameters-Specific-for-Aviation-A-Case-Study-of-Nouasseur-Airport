# Forecasting of Meteorological Parameters Specific for Aviation  
### A Case Study of Nouasseur Airport

## 📘 Overview
This project was conducted as part of my internship at the **Direction Générale de la Météorologie (DGM)** (Jul–Aug 2025).  
It focuses on **forecasting aviation-critical meteorological parameters** using data-driven and deep-learning approaches.  
The case study centers on **Nouasseur Airport (Morocco)**, with the goal of improving short- and medium-term weather predictions to support aviation safety.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a **reproducible forecasting pipeline** using **ERA5 hourly reanalysis data** (2016–2024).  
- Compare **classical statistical methods** with **deep learning architectures**.  
- Evaluate predictive performance for **temperature (T2M)** and **CAPE** on a held-out test year (2024).  
- Assess model robustness and operational potential for real-time applications.

## 🧠 Methods & Models
### Theoretical Exploration
Studied the mathematical foundations and predictive behavior of:
> ARIMA · SARIMAX · Holt’s Winter · Theta · k-NN · SVR · Random Forest · CNN · LSTM · Encoder–Decoder LSTM · Attention-based Encoder–Decoder

### Implemented Models
Only the most relevant models were implemented, tuned, and evaluated:
- **SARIMAX** — baseline statistical model (statsmodels)  
- **Univariate LSTM** — short-term temperature forecasting  
- **Encoder–Decoder LSTM** — 24-hour multi-step forecasting  
- **Attention-based Multivariate LSTM** — 24-hour CAPE forecasting  

All models were trained on **2020–2023** and tested on **2024** data.

## 📊 Results Summary
| Model | Variable | Forecast Horizon | MAE | Key Insight |
|--------|-----------|------------------|-----|--------------|
| SARIMAX | T2M | 1-hour | ~6.3 °C | Baseline statistical performance |
| LSTM | T2M | 1-hour | **0.71 °C** | ~88.8% reduction in MAE vs SARIMA |
| Encoder–Decoder LSTM | T2M | 24-hour | ~2.42 °C | Maintains diurnal pattern |
| Attention LSTM | CAPE | 24-hour | 32.5 → 76.3 J/kg | Captures instability trends |

✅ **Deep learning models significantly outperformed statistical baselines**, particularly for short-term temperature forecasting.
